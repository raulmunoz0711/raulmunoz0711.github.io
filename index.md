## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

*Lab 8: Part 1

  I enjoyed lab 8 because it allowed me to understand arguments and how an if statement should be properly used. I also understood that this was more opinion-based as we played a name-fill game where each player got their own guess. This was interesting and enjoyable as I was able to give each part an argument that allowed the user to fill in what they decided. Also, being able to use the variable to display the text of what they wrote. 

*Lab 9: Part 1

  This lab was about taking the judge's average score on Olympic events. I enjoy doing math and being able to combine that with code as I was able to identify if a new contestant would be higher or lower than the last along with being able to create rules in the code and being able to obtain the average. It is cool that with this code a judge can insert the scores of the rest of the judges and obtain an average for the athlete at hand. This helped with being able to apply math to my code and being able to format a response and demand from the user that will allow me to complete their desired request. 

*Lab 2: Part 1

  Although this lab was just changing the text this was enjoyable. It was my first lab and it brought me into the world of coding. It introduced the basic std::cout << “” which is something that was used in every lab. This easy lab was able to demonstrate to me my future and it gave me a sense of how coding was going to be in the future.
